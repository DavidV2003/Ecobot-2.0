Ecobot 2.0 is a project that seeks to employ and bring together neural networks to solve one of the world's biggest problems. 
Pollution generates not only an excessive waste of raw materials but also an energetic waste and the destruction of many animal habitats. 
This project seeks to generate a neural network capable of predicting the category of a waste to know what type it is and be able to recycle it.
